# 📊 Automate Budget Planning using Linear Programming  

This project automates the yearly budget allocation process for an **International Logistics Company**. Using **Linear Programming**, it selects projects that maximize **Return on Investment (ROI)** while adhering to management guidelines and budget constraints.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Optimal allocation of budget across projects  
- Ensures compliance with management policies  
- Maximizes overall ROI  
- Easily adaptable for different industries  
- Built in **Python (PuLP + Pandas)** for flexibility and transparency  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **Notebook (`Untitled142.ipynb`)** → Contains the full implementation of budget allocation using Linear Programming.  
- **Data Input** → Sample project list with costs, returns, and constraints.  
- **Solver Output** → Optimal set of projects chosen within budget.  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements  
Make sure you have the following installed:  

```bash
pip install pulp pandas
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run  
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled142.ipynb
   ```  
2. Run all cells to see the **budget optimization process**.  
3. Check the solver’s output for the optimal allocation of funds.  

---

## 📈 Example Output  
- List of selected projects  
- Maximum ROI achievable within constraints  
- Budget utilization summary  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- Add interactive dashboard with **Streamlit**  
- Allow CSV/Excel input for project details  
- Include scenario analysis (multiple budget limits)  
- Add visualization of allocations
